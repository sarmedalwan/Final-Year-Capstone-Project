# Online Turn-Based Multiplayer Game
This project will be a two-player online multiplayer strategy game, created in Java. The game will be turn-based, 
and will be set in WW2 and focused on Operation Mars, a famous operation on the eastern front around the city of Rzhev.

## Design of the Game

The game requires two players. One plays as the Soviets, and one plays as the Germans. The game is based on the historical battle Operation Mars. The users can click on units and move them in alternating turns.
Opposing units can engage in combat against each other. Each unit has a health value. The specific rules of the game will be decided and implemented in further versions. The units represent historical divisions,
which were thousands of men in strength historically. The players' territories will shift when their respective units move into their respective territories. A player must oppose and defeat the other player.

## Getting Started (Software Based)

### Prerequisites
What do I need in order to get your project running? For example,
* IntelliJ Idea 2016 (or later)
* Image editing software

### Installing

The game can presently be run from the command line or from the IntelliJ IDE [1]

#### Install libraries and run program

```
gson 2.8.2
```

### Running Tests

Tests are currently built-in and will simply print values to the IntelliJ console. Otherwise, testing the game involves running and attempting to play it in various ways.

### Versioning Statergy
I will use semantic versioning for my software.

## Getting Started (Hardware Based)

### Pre-requisites

Working modern computer capable of running Windows 7 or later, with network connectivity, and capable of running IntelliJ Idea 2016 or later
