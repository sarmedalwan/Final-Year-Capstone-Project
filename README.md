# Project Title
A *brief* paragraph explaining your project and what it does should be written here. The idea is to give readers an overview of what it is that you've built.

## Getting Started (Software Based)
You should write a bit about **how** I can get your project working, It's good to think in terms of the following sections:

### Prerequisites
What do I need in order to get your project running? For example,
* Python 3.5 (or later)
* sqlalchemy

### Installing
A step by step guide on how to build and install your software, for example:

#### Edit the configuration file
In myconfig.ini, change the following settings to match your requirements:

```
database_name=test
database_user=test
database_pass=password
```

#### Install libraries and run program

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

### Running Tests
How do I run your tests? Make it as easy as possible to do this!

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./tests.py
```

### Versioning Statergy
What versioning statergy are you using for your project, something like [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) might be a good idea.
